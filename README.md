## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of a C program that implements an LL(1) parser generator. The program reads a context-free grammar from a file, performs necessary transformations to make it suitable for LL(1) parsing, calculates FIRST and FOLLOW sets, and finally constructs a parsing table.

LL(1) parsers are top-down parsers that analyze input from left to right, constructing a leftmost derivation, and using a single token of lookahead to make parsing decisions. They are powerful tools for implementing compilers and interpreters.

## 2. Program Overview

The program performs the following major operations:

1. Reads a context-free grammar from a file
2. Processes special grammar notations (like T' to represent T-prime)
3. Performs left factoring on the grammar
4. Eliminates left recursion from the grammar
5. Identifies terminals and non-terminals
6. Calculates FIRST sets for all non-terminals
7. Calculates FOLLOW sets for all non-terminals
8. Constructs the LL(1) parsing table
9. Displays all intermediate and final results

## 3. Key Data Structures

The program uses several important data structures:

- `production[50][10]`: Stores production rules (up to 50 rules, each with up to 10 characters)
- `calc_first[10][100]`: Stores FIRST sets for non-terminals
- `calc_follow[10][100]`: Stores FOLLOW sets for non-terminals
- `terminals[10]` and `terminals_count`: Stores terminal symbols and their count
- `non_terminals[10]` and `non_terminals_count`: Stores non-terminal symbols and their count
- `parsing_table[10][10][10]`: 3D array representing the parsing table
- `nt_map[26][2]`: Maps non-terminal symbols with apostrophes (like T') to new symbols (like X, Y, Z)

## 4. Grammar Processing

### Reading from File

The function `read_grammar_from_file()` handles reading grammar rules from a text file. It processes each line as follows:

1. Removes whitespace
2. Identifies the production rule by finding the "->" symbol
3. Separates the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS)
4. Handles special cases like non-terminals with apostrophes (T')
5. Splits alternatives (separated by "|") into separate production rules
6. Converts the rules into the internal format used by the program

```c
void read_grammar_from_file(const char* filename) {
    FILE* file = fopen(filename, "r");
    /* Process each line from the file... */
}
```

The internal format represents production rules as follows:
- First character: Non-terminal on the left-hand side
- Second character: '=' (separator)
- Remaining characters: Right-hand side of the production

For example, "A -> aB | c" would be stored as two productions: "A=aB" and "A=c".

### Handling Special Grammar Cases

The program has special handling for:

1. **Non-terminals with apostrophes**: When a non-terminal like T' appears, it's replaced with an available uppercase letter (starting from X, Y, Z).
2. **Epsilon productions**: The empty string is represented as '#'.
3. **Multiple alternatives**: Rules with alternatives (using the '|' symbol) are split into separate productions.

```c
char get_nt_replacement(char c) {
    // Start with Available non-terminals from X to Z
    static char available = 'X';
    /* Get or create a replacement for non-terminals with apostrophes */
}
```

## 5. Left Factoring

Left factoring is a grammar transformation that involves factoring out common prefixes from production alternatives. The function `perform_left_factoring()` implements this process:

1. For each production rule:
   - Find alternatives that share a common prefix
   - Extract the common prefix
   - Create a new non-terminal
   - Replace the original production with a factored version

```c
void perform_left_factoring() {
    /* Find common prefixes and factor them out */
}
```

For example, the rule "A -> αβ | αγ" would be transformed into:
- "A -> αX"
- "X -> β | γ"

where X is a new non-terminal.

## 6. Left Recursion Elimination

Left recursion makes top-down parsing problematic. The program eliminates it through two functions:

1. `eliminate_immediate_left_recursion()`: Handles direct left recursion (e.g., "A -> Aα | β")
2. `remove_left_recursion()`: Coordinates the overall process

```c
void eliminate_immediate_left_recursion(int prod_index) {
    /* Transform productions with immediate left recursion */
}

void remove_left_recursion() {
    /* Coordinate the left recursion elimination process */
}
```

For a production like "A -> Aα | β", the transformation results in:
- "A -> βA'"
- "A' -> αA' | ε"

where A' is a new non-terminal.

## 7. Symbol Identification

After transforming the grammar, the program identifies all terminals and non-terminals using the `identify_symbols()` function:

```c
void identify_symbols() {
    /* Extract terminals and non-terminals from the production rules */
}
```

This function:
1. Adds all non-terminals from the left-hand sides of productions
2. Adds all terminals from the right-hand sides
3. Adds '$' as a special terminal (end marker)

## 8. FIRST Set Calculation

The FIRST set of a symbol or string contains all terminals that can appear as the first symbol of any string derived from it. The program calculates FIRST sets using `findfirst()`:

```c
void findfirst(char c, int q1, int q2) {
    /* Calculate FIRST set for a non-terminal */
}
```

For a non-terminal A:
1. If A → a... where a is a terminal, add a to FIRST(A)
2. If A → B... where B is a non-terminal, add FIRST(B) to FIRST(A)
3. If A → ε, add ε to FIRST(A)
4. If A → B... and ε is in FIRST(B), add FIRST(next symbol) to FIRST(A)

## 9. FOLLOW Set Calculation

The FOLLOW set of a non-terminal A contains all terminals that can appear immediately to the right of A in any sentential form. The calculation uses `follow()` and `followfirst()`:

```c
void follow(char c) {
    /* Calculate FOLLOW set for a non-terminal */
}

void followfirst(char c, int c1, int c2) {
    /* Helper function for FOLLOW set calculation */
}
```

For a non-terminal A:
1. If A is the start symbol, add $ to FOLLOW(A)
2. If there is a production B → αAβ, add FIRST(β) - {ε} to FOLLOW(A)
3. If there is a production B → αA or B → αAβ where ε is in FIRST(β), add FOLLOW(B) to FOLLOW(A)

## 10. Parsing Table Construction

Using the calculated FIRST and FOLLOW sets, the program builds an LL(1) parsing table with `create_parsing_table()`:

```c
void create_parsing_table() {
    /* Construct the LL(1) parsing table */
}
```

For each production A → α:
1. For each terminal a in FIRST(α), add A → α to table[A, a]
2. If ε is in FIRST(α), for each terminal b in FOLLOW(A), add A → α to table[A, b]

The parsing table is represented as a 3D array `parsing_table[10][10][10]`, where:
- First dimension: index of non-terminal
- Second dimension: index of terminal
- Third dimension: the production string to use

## 11. Implementation Details

### Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling, such as checking if the grammar file exists:

```c
FILE* file = fopen(filename, "r");
if (file == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening file: %s\n", filename);
    exit(1);
}
```

However, it does not include comprehensive error checking for invalid grammars or conflicts in the parsing table.

### Memory Management

The program uses fixed-size arrays for storing productions, sets, and the parsing table. This simplifies memory management but limits the size of grammars it can process.

### Algorithm Complexity

- Left factoring: O(n²) where n is the number of productions
- Left recursion elimination: O(n²)
- FIRST and FOLLOW set calculation: O(n²)
- Parsing table construction: O(n × t) where t is the number of terminals

## 12. Conclusion

This program demonstrates the complete process of converting a context-free grammar into an LL(1) parsing table:

1. It transforms the grammar through left factoring and left recursion elimination
2. It calculates FIRST and FOLLOW sets using recursive algorithms
3. It constructs a parsing table based on these sets

The resulting parsing table can be used to implement an LL(1) parser that efficiently analyzes strings according to the grammar.

While this implementation has limitations in terms of grammar size and error handling, it provides a clear illustration of the theoretical concepts behind LL(1) parsing.
